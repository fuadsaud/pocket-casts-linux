Pocket Casts is the world's most powerful podcast player. It's a great app to
discover and listen to your favorite podcasts. Many blogs have deemed Pocket
Casts the best podcatcher around.

You need to have a pre-existing Pocket Casts account (it's cheap and worth the
money) to use this app. You can purchase Pocket Casts on their
